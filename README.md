# Covid-19-Map
This Covid-19 Map allows users to see the spread of the corona virus around the world and in the United states. 
It was built using html, bootstrap, JavaScript along with APIs and used the mapbox API to generate the base map template.
The data visualized on the map from a Covid-19 API (https://www.trackcorona.live/api) where the current data is available for free.
I used the Fetch API to fetch the data and parsed the response as JSON data which was then visualized on the maps. The data is refreshed every 30 minutes.
